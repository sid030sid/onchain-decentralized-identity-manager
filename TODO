think about neccessitz of adding eddsa in circuit directly, making the python script obsolete (see main.zok for more info regarding this TODO)
implement zokrates code for proving control over private key through public key deriviation or signature verification --> part of the evaluation to compare both approaches (thrid approach is to verify signature on-chain)
add ZKP verification to function addIdentity
attempt to write tests of ODIM in hardhat using zokratesJS: https://zokrates.github.io/toolbox/zokrates_js.html

discuss whether it makes sense that the babyjubjub curve can be used for proving ownership of every private key type, e.g. ed25510, scp256k1, p256 etc.?

once ODIM deploys make demo video or description of how one can create ZKP for adding identity
once ODIM deployed make demo video of how once can use it on etherscan to manage decentrlaized identities
once ODIM deployed to testnet provide script in ethersJS to use ODIM for querying its decentralized identity registry and describe how to do it in
