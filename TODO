Debug: publicKey value of an identity must be included in the identity itself otherwise one can use the same ZKP to add multiple different identities that all point to the same public key. since this does not make much sense for the user, this bug can remain for now.
make a test that shows how to use ODIM for querying its decentralized identity registry and reference this test in readme
make demo video or description of how one can create ZKP for adding identity
